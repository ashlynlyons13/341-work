compare 2 websites + what did i do / struggle with?

With advanced HTML editors, it has become a simple task to design and launch a Web site. Professional Web site designers can bring graphic design elements to Web sites, and some conventions have evolved over the brief history of the Web, such as the use of links and tabs. Did you know google existed in 2002? It was a very basic looking website (no exciting logo changes) but it served the same purpose as a search engine. the tabs of "web" and "images" were there, but look dated compared to what we know today. And the shopping and extra tab options we have now, had not yet been installed. From what I've read, the auto fill in also wasn't as good. Now, when we type in a W - google is already trying to guess what we mean based on common searches. This was a feature back then, but with slower connections and less data inputted to base predictions off of, it was often little help. The search bar is also much smaller, in comparison to what we see now. It looks like an older, smaller, worse version of a search engine we depend on so much to day. 

In  this asignment I didn't muhc trouble with the coding itself, I did my second page link as an external link on accident, but when I went back and reread it, I made the switch and the link worked. Like other assignments the submission proccess proved to be most difficult. But now that I have my repo fixed, I'm hoping to have a much easier time with this class!
