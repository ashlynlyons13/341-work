In this weeks assignments, I struggled getting my personal photos and my own video to show up in my web page. The pictures showed my caption and a little x in the corner of an empty box. My video showed an empty black box with a "this type of video is not supported" logo.

Now that I know the commands for a questionaire and contact page, those requirements were easily met. I enjoy creating these pages, but feel mine remain rather plain. They are clear and easy to navigate but not super interesting to look at.

learning how to embed videos from the internet was really valuable because youtube has so much content these days, it's hepful to be able to share that with your webpage.
