I consider myself to be decently tech savvy, but this course truly frustrates me more than anything. I have learned so much with text editors, repositories, etc. But still find myself very overwhelmed. First I had a problem because I use an older Window's model. Then I was out of town for softball and unable to attend the computer lab for help that I honestly need. On that trip for softball, I put my laptop in my Checked baggage and upon it's return it no longer worked. This caused me to fall behind even more. I then took my laptop to "Computer Guys" when we returned to Missoula and I didn't get it back until Wednesday 2/22. They had to replace the charging port because it had been dented and shaken loose upon poor care by the airline. Now that I have my laptop back and have directions to followed based on a window's model, I thought I could catch up on assignments 2 and 3, then move forward with little issue. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. I have all the different applications downloaded and have no problem editing text and following the directions. But When I try to link my github desktop to github.com, I only have a "sync" option. when it should be "publish". This makes me think that my homework won't go through because everything isn't linked properly.
I am now on the road again (well technically, on a plane going to hawaii) for another softball tournament. Hoping that I can figure out how to submit this assignment along with homework 3 before FINALLY being able to come to a lab next week. I am optimistic and have a ton of questions, and with help I know I will succeed in this course. But trying to navigate it on my own with excess adversity has really confused me.
I wish I had the knowledge to aid my classmates in their issues, but tend to have the same issues others are having. My issue posts are often my own personal questions, hoping that someone else will have insight for me. But as I progress I hope that I will be able to give advice to my classmates as well.
Another issue I had, that I am about to post in the 'issues' about is screenshotting my work ony my laptop. I have a Toshiba with window's and I have tried multiple commands with no luck. So until I can figure that out I am taking pictures of my computer screen with my phone, and uploading it that way.
