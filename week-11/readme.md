This week I really enjoyed the concepts we learned with parallax, I thought this made even the simplest site look trendy and interesting just based on format.
I didn't have any particular issues with this assignment, aside from trying to use my images as jpgs when one of the was a npg. And the break I took in between when I started the assignment and when i finished it due to other papers and finals definitely didnt help me. In certain places I was mid-code of a section or style and couldn't remember exactly where I wanted to go with my work when I came back to it. I had to rename a few things and go back through my previous work and look at titles and colors and different things to connect the dots but the site ended up working, (there might and probably is extra things in my code that arent needed) But I'm happy with the finished product.


Wrote this readme before I realized that my "online" site comes through as plain text on a white screen, as if my css isn't connected. I sent all changes through get hub and have no issues in my files, but when using the link to view my live site, it doesn't come through. I've tried every combination of commands in my link and cant find my own error..so here is a picture of what it should look like labeled "capture" in week 11's homework. That shows what it looks like in my index file..but when I upload it doesnt appear that way.
