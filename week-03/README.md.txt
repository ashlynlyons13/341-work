I felt really confident working through the directions to build this index - I used basic commands of <p></p> for paragraph, 
<h1>, <h2> , etc for heading 1, heading 2, so on. 

But I struggled getting it "onto the web."
when I open it from my file, it takes me to the webpage. But I wasn't able to get it onto github and make it visible for anyone to find on the internet.
