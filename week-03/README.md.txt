I felt really confident working through the directions to build this index - I used basic commands of <p></p> for paragraph, 
<h1>, <h2> , etc for heading 1, heading 2, so on. 

But I struggled getting it "onto the web."
when I open it from my file, it takes me to the webpage. But I wasn't able to get it onto github and make it visible for anyone to find on the internet. 

we later found out this was because my repo wasn't set up correctly, but has since then been fixed. I also had saved these as readme.md.txt rather than readme.md, once that error was fixed they opened properly.
