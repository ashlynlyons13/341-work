<h2> Fire and Ice</h3>
<h4> by Robert Frost</h4>
<p>Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice. </p>
<p>From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.</p>
<p>But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate.
To say that for destruction ice
is also great, And would suffice. </p>
