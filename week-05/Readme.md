For week 5 I found the questionare to be more up my alley, I was able to get creative and design as well as code the webpage itself. Following the directions was easy and the content was really interesting. I enjoyed being able to control the size of my pictures and being able to input them throughout the questions to create a fun atmosphere. The size and title information for images was something I had never thought of before when looking at websites.  And the complexity of building a dropdown for answers to a simple question was surprising.

I used <img src = "images/    .jpeg" alt = "  " title = "  " width = "  " height = "  "> and found this to be the most useful thing I learned this week. With the kind of pages I would like to build with blogs and art in the future, and a possible photography career.. the input of images was my favorite.

<img src = "images/HW 5 code screenshot" alt = "screenshot" title = "screenshot" width = "800" height = "800">
