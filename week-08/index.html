    <h4>Ball Park music!</h4>

    <p>We always play tunes at the field, it motivates the athletes and entertains the fans! Often times Monte even dances along.</p>
<div id= song><p><br><em>"Take me out to the ball game,</br>
<br>Take me out with the crowd.</br>
<br>Buy me some peanuts and cracker jack,</br>
<br>I don't care if I never get back,</br>
<br>Let me root, root, root for the home team,</br>
<br>If they don't win it's a shame.</br>
<br>For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out,</br>
<br>At the old ball game."</br></em>
