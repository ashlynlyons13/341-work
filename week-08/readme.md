Week 8,
I found this section to be more difficult conceptually. But not necessarily more difficult to complete. The extra variable of css was cool to add color and more life to the page, but the idea of my code being altered from a separate page that I also wrote made it easy for common errors. If I didn't match up my titles or commands just right then I didn't get the outcome I wanted. I find it very interesting that every color has a specific and recognizable code that registers with computers/code universally. The more creativity we are able to have the more drawn I am to learning the material. As long as I follow the steps, I don't have many problems writing the code itself..once I understand the concepts of what is happening. * I think that is the biggest part, I may memorize what to type..but not understand why it is that I am typing it. But as I read through the examples/steps more and more it becomes easier.

When doing this assignment I started with basic text and picture code to get an idea of what my index may look like. After I built the shape I went back and edited where I wanted text to be aligned, how big I wanted images to appear, etc. Then I started my Css and began choosing font colors, my main background, and features to emphasize my news story. I did the body first since that is the majority of my work, then went into greater detail with the headers, and finished with the special things like hover, emphasis, italics and individual backgrounds.

my favorite part of this was choosing colors and learning just how vast and technical all of my options are. My least favorite part was originally trying to understand the idea of linking the fonts and what method I should use (in the index, in the css, embeded) but after I studied it again, I was able to find commands that made sense to me and gave me the results I wanted.
